								<strong>What is CNC?</strong> <br>
                            CNC standing for computer numerical control is a system that will take take in programmed instructions to automatically
                            run a job whether it be milling, lathe, drill... and so forth. Technically 3d printers, laser engravers, vinyl cutter, and
                            any other tool you program using a computer is a CNC machine. In order to use a CNC machine one need to take their CAD file 
                            and import it into a CAM software which will then turn the design into machine code the machine can understand. Then you simply 
                            using the machines controller or control panel in order to zero it and run the machine code.
                            <br><br>
                            The machine we are using in this project is a mill and more specifically a 3-axis mill. A mill is composed of  a few different
                            important parts that are crucial to understand in order to use it effectively. Going through the basic parts there is the gantry
                            which is a general term used for the portion of the mill that moves along the axis, there is then the spindle which is a motor
                            that spins at around 18000 RPM. Connected to the spindle is the collet and collet nut which will hold the bit in place. The bit 
                            simply being the actual tool used to make the cut. There is a vast array of available bits (that I will talk to you about buying) 
                            more of, from endmills to drills, to surfacing tools, tapered bits and more. Next to the collet and bit and surrounding it is the 
                            dust collector connected to a vaccum to keep wood and other material dust from flying everywhere. Finally the last thing to discuss 
                            is the axis. The axis are the direction the spindle can move in (NOT THE GANTRY). Our CNC mill is 3 axis, and so can move in the 
                            x,y, and z directions allowing it to do 2 axis, 2.5 axis, and 3 axis milling operations.  In the other room we have a 5-axis mill
                            meaning that the spindle can now be angled in diagonal directions allowing for more complex cuts.

								<strong>Learning to use the 3 Axis Mill with V-Carve</strong> <br>
                               I wish to preface this with Spencer was amazing, he was a wonderful teacher, and great at explaining about the mill and was 
                               clearly talented in the field, however not even the smartest person can convince me that V-Carve is not an awful software. From 
                               the terrible UI and excuse for a CAD software that makes me consider Blender as a better option, to the lack of options and no simulation
                               or collision detection CAM section. Using the glorified MS pain "CAD" tool I made myself a few shaped to get familliar with the software.
                               Then talked through a plan where I would make two squares one to shell and the other to cut, and I would then add two different things on 
                               each of the squares to be engraved. So the idea would be to engrave the square to be cut out, cut the square, shell the other square, then
                               take the cut square and put it into the shell in the opposite direction. Then I would re-zero the tool and cut the engrave that was on 
                               top of the shell which would get a two faced operation on the piece of wood that was cut out.
                               <br> <br>
                               Getting started in doing this I made the two squares then added a star and my name on one square and a pentagon on top of the other. I 
                               then switched to the CAM section and selected the engrave operation, decided to use a V-bit and inputted the provided parameters by Spencer.
                               Then I selected the pentagon, selected the shell operation, and used a 1/4 inch endmill downcut as the tool of choice. Then I selected the 
                               square to be cut out, selected the contour operation (this is the name in Fusion I forgot what it was in V-Carve), selected a 1/4 inch
                               endmill as the tool of choice, and added 4 tabs around the piece so it would not move. Finally I selected the last square, selected the 
                               shell operation using a 1/4 inch downcut endmill again, and added t-bones to the corned to allow the other square to slot it easier. I 
                               then numbered each of the operations in the order initally described, and put them on a USB key.

                               First thing to do was then turn on the machine and move the gantry out of the way. Then we got a piece of stock, used
                               carpet tape on the bottom, and secured it will a drill and screws to the table. Then used the controller to set the X and
                               Y Zero point. Next we removed the dust collector, and used a pair of wrenches to remove the collet nut and take out the collet.
                               We then put into the cullet a V-Bit and resecured the collet with the collet nut. Then using a calibration tool we set the Z to
                               zero at our stock. Then I reattached the dust collector and ran the first engrave operation. I then changed the tool to a 1/4 inch
                               end mill and ran the cut and shell operation. Using a cutting tool I removed the tabs and put the cut out square in the shell.
                               I then reused the zero tool to zero the z to the stock that is now in the shell and ran the final shell operation to get hte final 
                               product.

								<strong>Design Project for CNC</strong> <br>
                                For my CNC project I decided to do 3 things, and am hoping to make a collection soon of them. I designed the other project
                                available from the first week of Fusion 360, so the biological hazard symbol which can be CNC milled, and I also implemented
                                toolpaths for both the radioactive symbol and the chemical symbol in Fusion 360. Now designing just a single of these symbols
                                without a guide I would consider a creative design as it requires you to come up with your own ideas on how to define the shaped 
                                and how you can relate everyhting geometrically in Fusion to get a fully defined sketch, and considering there is an infinite amount
                                of ways to do this then an idea to come up with making these designs is inherently creative, as I am sure you would agree that not
                                only art and design requires a creative mind, but creativity plays a crucial role in both mathematics and geometry. And due to
                                the lack of description on how creativity is graded in your rubric I am assuming that you would be welcoming of geometric creativity
                                and weight it equally to artistic creativity.
                                <br> <br>
                                Starting with creating the Biohazard symbol the way I made it was by initally making the base like the other symbols,
                                and extruding it upwards. Then I proceeded to make a sketch on top of the base. What I creatively realized was the the 
                                three large circles intersect in the middle, so started by making that, then had the creative idea of connecting three 
                                circles with an equlateral triangle. to make the circles equally spaced apart. I then added a horizontal constraint
                                to the bottom side of the triangle, and made all the circles equal size. Then with this basis the rest turned easy.
                                I then made the center circle, and offset outer circle. The following steps I approached creatively due to not
                                having a plan beforehand, and made a then made anoter circle centered at the origin the would be coincident with
                                the three outer circles where the outcircles interect making a 3 way intersection point. Then within the top circle
                                I added two smaller circles inside that were tangential both of which connected to the origin with different length
                                lines. I repeated this on all the other curecles with the same dimensions set up, and made a few connecting parallel
                                lines to get the final sketch. I then extruded, and added an appearence to get the end result. A 2d thing that I CNC 
                                cut that I made creatively.

								<strong>CNC Project Goal</strong> <br>
                            What I am hoping to be able to do is make a variety of symbols that I can mill out easily and constantly that I can then
                            sell off as either decoration, coasters, and other needs. Plus I just really like them. I am starting with being able 
                            to mill just these three logos, but then hope to be able to make superhero logos like spiderman and Deadpool and other
                            circular things in simmilar fasion. As so I kept being creative and learned more in toolpaths in Fusion and made
                            a radioactive symbol and chemical symbol and milled them. Unfortunatley I forgot to take a photo of the chemical one since 
                            I did it to train Lily (extra creative I know 2 in 1) and gave it to her as she wanted to hang it in her room. (see my creative
                            idea exists and has oppertunity). For the radioactive symbol I did a pocket to clear the middle and a contour to cut it 
                            out with a 1/4 inch endmill but that did not leave a clean cut. In the chemical symbol I changed tactics creatively and 
                            decided to try out a tapered bit with a finishing contour for the middle parts, bu the tapered bit caused it to cut 
                            jagged. Now I want to ask you to buy for us an 1/8 inch endmill to use so we can try that for more precise cuts.
