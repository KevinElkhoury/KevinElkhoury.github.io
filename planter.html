								<strong>Tools used in Fusion 360</strong> <br>
                                For this project new tools need to be used in Fusion 360 to be succesful. Last week we learned the basics of how to use Fusion
                                360 and making simple skethes and extruding them, but for this week things are more complex. This week 2 projects are going to be
                                made first off a planter will be designed in Fusion 360 using the fundamentals learned last week, and some new features, then
                                the design will be taken from Fusion 360 into prusa slices and sliced using a special setting called vase mode which allows it
                                to be printed in a specicific way. In addition to that we then designed a watering can using more new tools taught to us.<br> <br>
                                
                                Going through all the new tools taught to us. Starting off we learned the circular pattern tool, which is very similar to rectangualar
                                pattern tool. What it does is it takes a sketch profile and repeats it following a cirle around a point or axis. Following that we 
                                learned the fillet tool which curves the edges to our designs making them smooth instead of sharp. We also learned the shell tool 
                                which hollows out an 3d object either entirely or by also removing one side allowing the user to set the thickens of the walls of 
                                the hollowed out model. We also learned how to make offset planes. Offselt planes let us make new constuction planes to work on
                                like the original xy, xz, and yz planes, that reference another point or plant, to build off of. There is a variety of offset
                                planes that can be made for example planes tangential to an curve, perpendicular planes, parallel planes, planes at angles to
                                a reference line and so forth. This allows for the creation of more complex projects in 3d space.  <br> <br>

                                In addition to that we learned how to fully define our sketches. For a sketch to be fully defined means that no part of it can be
                                moved without altering a constraint. This makes it easier to work in 3d projects and sclale designs since everyhting is fully
                                defined you cannot make any adjustments later in the project that will mess up or alter something you initially worked on.

								<strong>Making a Vase in Fusion 360</strong> <br>
                                Making the vase itself was a very simple task to do. Started off by making an initial base circle then adding a second circle near
                                the edge. The trim tool was then used to cut the circle to the intescetion point wioth the larger cirle. The circular pattern tool
                                was then used to repeat the trimmed circle arround the large base circle. Following then the design was extruded upwards. This was
                                then saves as an STL to be used in prusa slicer to turn into vase mode. Continuing on Fusion 360 though I then shelled the vase clicking on
                                the top profile to hollow out the vase and remove the top. Then I filleted the top edge to smooth it out, making the final vase.

								<strong>Vase Mode in Prusa Slicer</strong> <br>
                                Taking the file exported from Fusion 360 was then imported into Prusa Slicer. No supports or  brim is needed fro the print, and
                                prusa Slicer and Fusion both work in mm, so no values have to be changed when importing. That means all that was left to do was 
                                activate vase mode, slice the model, export the gCode and print it. I did this with ocotoprint since I was lazy and did not want to
                                get off the couch.

								<strong>Creating Additional Pages</strong> <br>
								Finally now that the home and navigation bar are finalized all that is left to do is make the additional pages. The first
								page I made is the About Me page where I simply made an html and css file, linked the about me css file and the main css file
								to the aboutme html file, and copied in my nav bar and footer. The nav bar did not copy in as nicely as I hoped since it
								was taking part of the header, so to not mess up my main page I created a new class to put in the nav bar division that I then
								defined and adjusted in the about css for the nav bar to be aligned properly. I then made two classes one for text, and the 
								other for image and definined them both in the CSS file setting the image aligned right and text aligned left and setting them
								both to be inline allowing them to be side by side as seen in the image below. I then wrote in the About Me text and finalized
								my CSS adjustments with size and location then moved on to the next page. <br> <br>
								
								Next I made a contact me page, which in essense was inherently simple. I simply found a template for it online and imported in its
								appropriate CSS, HTML and Java Script. I then made my own division with its own class to properly align the contact me section to
								be in the center of the page and not overlap with the nav bar or footer that I imported from the About Me page when I first made this page.
								All that was then left was to make a second page which the user would be brought to saying "Thank You" in the middle of the page, which
								I did by making a CSS class, with access to a nav bar to return to the main page or any page the user wants to visit next. <br> <br>

								Finally I made my portfolio page for an easy way to access each weeks project. For this I found a template called Phantom with its own
								CSS, HTML, and Java Script Files. I simply then imported them in, and started remving all the sections except for the boxes that I was using.
								I then implemented my own nav bar which took a lot of adjusting in the CSS needing to change its padding a lot, then simple placed the footer 
								at the end of the HTML file. I then filled it with an image of this project and set the rest to coming soon. <br> <br>

								Then once this was all done I simply used GitBash to navigate to this folder add it, commit it, and push it to my repository.
